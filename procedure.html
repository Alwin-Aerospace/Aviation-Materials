<h2 >Experimental Setup & Procedure</h2>
</div>
<div class="ne">
<p class="sgf">This project main role is to give solutions for the problems occured in
roof panel and overhead bins of an aircraft. So, the materials used in
the existing panel are altered by giving new materials based upon their
properties to solve the problems.
Problems occured in existing panel are:</p>
<ul class="sgf">
<li>cracking and fatigue - roof panel skin</li>
<li>corrosion - around fasteners, rivets</li>
<li>delamination - composite skins</li>
<li>lightining strike damage - causes roof panel damage</li>
<li>hail damage the roof panel</li>
<li>water leakage - causes corrosion</li>
<li>paint & coating degradation - requires repainting</li>
<li>age related wear</li>
</ul>
<p class="sgf">There are three layers in the existing panel as the both skin layers are
consists of S-Glass fibre and the middle layer is of honey comb the
honey comb structure is made up of aramid fibre. These layers are
fabricated by the matrix called phenolic prepreg.
While, considering the problems occured in the existing panel a new
type of innovative panel has been made by based upon the properties
of the materials.
Innovative panel has five layers in the panel as both skin layers are
madeup of aramid fibre , 2nd and 4th layers are madeup of S-Glass
fibre and the 3rd middle layer is madeup of carbon fibre.
Aramid fibres are given to skin for attaining better corrosion
resistance and to prevent the water leakage. S-Glass fibre are given to
prevent the cracks and fatique occured in roof of the aircrafts.
Carbon fibre plays the most vital role in the innovative panel to give
more strength to withstand the compression and impacts loads such as
lightining strike and hail damage.
These both panels are designed in CATIA V5 and analysed through
 simulation software.</p>

   <h3 class="we">1. S-Glass Fiber :</h3>
   <p>A fiberglass is a form of fiber-reinforced plastic where glass fiber is thereinforced plastic. This is the reason perhaps why fiberglass is also knownas glass reinforced plastic or glass fiber reinforced plastic. The glass fiberis usually flattened into a sheet, randomly arranged or woven into a fabric.According to the use of the fiberglass, the glass fibers can be made ofdifferent types of glass. Fiberglass is lightweight, strong and less brittle.The best part of fiberglass is its ability to get molded into various complexshapes. This pretty much explains why fiberglass is widely used in bathtubs,boats, aircraft, roofing, and other applications.</p>

   <h3 class="we">2. Carbon Fiber</h3>
   <p>Carbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a
composite. For example, when permeated with a plastic resin and baked, it
forms carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (often referred to as carbon fiber),
which has a very high strength-to-weight ratio and is extremely rigid although
somewhat brittle. Carbon fibers are also composited with other materials,
such as graphite, to form reinforced carbon-carbon composites, which have a
very high heat tolerance. Carbon fibers have several advantages:
high stiffness, high tensile strength, high strength to weight ratio, high chemical
resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion. These
properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace, civil engineering,
military, motorsports, and other competition sports. However, they are
relatively expensive compared to similar fibers, such as glass fiber, basalt
fibers, or plastic fibers.To produce a carbon fiber, the carbon atoms are bonded together in crystals
that are more or less aligned parallel to the fiber's long axis as the crystal
alignment gives the fiber a high strength-to-volume ratio (in other words, it is
strong for its size). Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to
form a tow, which may be used by itself or woven into a fabric.</p>

    <h3 class="we">3.Aramid Fiber</h3>
    <p>Aramid fibers, short for aromatic polyamide, are a class of heat-resistant
and strong synthetic fibers. They are used in aerospace and military
applications, for ballistic-rated body armor fabric and ballistic composites,
in marine cordage, marine hull reinforcement, as an asbestos substitute,[3]
and in various lightweight consumer items ranging from phone cases to
tennis rackets. The chain molecules in the fibers are highly oriented along the fiber axis. As
a result, a higher proportion of the chemical bond contributes more to fiber
strength than in many other synthetic fibers. Aramids have a very high
melting point (>500 °C (932 °F)).Aramid fiber is an organic fiber of the aromatic polyamide family. It has
good mechanical properties in terms of low density, high tenacity, and high
impact resistance. Aramid fiber is a good insulator of electricity and heat
and is resistant to organic solvents, fuels, and lubricants.</p>

<h3 class="we">4.Epoxy Resin</h3>
<p>Epoxy resin are categorised as compounds with one or more epoxide (or
oxirane) groups. Most epoxies can be categorised as glycidated, epoxied oils
or cycloaliphatic resins. The most popular epoxy resins are either diglycidyl
ethers of bisphenol A, which is created by reacting bisphenol A (BPA) with
epichlorohydrin (ECH). The molecular weight is controlled by adjusting the
ratio of ECH to BPA; high ratios generate lower molecular weights. Within this,
an increase of BPA adds strength in the form of rigidity and high-temperature
characteristics. Conversely, the ECH adds chemical resistance; hydroxyl and
epoxy groups add adhesive properties. Curing, also known as hardening, is a
vital part of realising the physical and chemical attributes of epoxy. Epoxy
resins are no different and curing is often triggered by adding a gardener.
Amine- based hardeners are particularly popular. Versus polyester resin curing,
where the resin is catalysed by adding a small amount of catalyst (e.g., 1 to 4 %
MEKP), epoxies require a curing agent to be added in a significantly higher
amount. Typically, this ranges from 1:1 to 2:1 resin to hardener. Further
strengthening of the epoxy can be achieved by adding a thermoplastic polymer.

  <h3 class="we">5.Fly Ash</h3>
  <p>Fly ash is produced from the combustion of coal in electric utility or
industrial boilers. There are four basic types of coal-fired boilers: pulverized
coal (PC), stoker-fired or traveling grate, cyclone, and fluidized-bed combustion
(FBC) boilers. The PC boiler is the most widely used, especially for large
electric generating units. The other boilers are more common at industrial or
cogeneration facilities. Fly ashes produced by FBC boilers are not considered in
this document. Fly ash is captured from the flue gases using electrostatic
precipitators (ESP) or in filter fabric collectors, commonly referred to as
baghouses. The physical and chemical characteristics of fly ash vary among
combustion methods, coal source, and particle shape. Fly ash (FA)—a coal combustion residue of thermal power stations—has been
recognized as a soil ameliorator throughout the world. Usually, FA contains
essential plant micro- and macronutrients and unique physicochemical
properties. Besides, several hazardous substances, such as metal(loid)s, organic
pollutants, and radioactive elements, are present in FA. FA disposal on land
leads to unwanted changes in soil systems, including contamination with
hazardous pollutants. Practical value of FA application in land offers extensive
chances in soil systems, mainly for nutrient supplementation, pH correction,
and ameliorating the soil physical conditions. In general, nitrogen and organic
carbon are absent in FA. Moreover, phosphorus is also present in unavailable
form.</p>
