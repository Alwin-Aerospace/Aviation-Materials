    <p>To give solutions for the material problems in roof panel and overhead bins of an aircraft by using composite. 
This research presents the design and analysis of a novel hybrid fiber composite solution addressing critical challenges 
in aircraft roof panel structural integrity, weight reduction, and sustainability. The proposed
composite integrates carbon, glass, and aramid fibers with advanced polymers to
create a lightweight, high-strength, and durable material. Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) and simulation testing were employed to evaluate the mechanical properties,
damage tolerance, and stability of the composite.The increasing demand for
lightweight, high-strength materials in the aerospace industry has driven the
development of innovative composite materials. This research presents the design and
analysis of a hybrid fiber composite solution aimed at addressing structural challenges
in aircraft. Hybrid composites, combining different types of fibers such as carbon,
glass, and aramid, are explored to achieve a balance of stiffness, strength, and impact
resistance while maintaining low weight. The study employs finite element analysis
(FEA) to evaluate the mechanical properties and performance of these composites
under various loading conditions encountered in aircraft roof panels. The design
focuses on optimizing the fiber orientation and matrix selection to enhance durability,
fatigue resistance, and damage tolerance. Simulation validation through mechanical
testing, such as tensile, compression, and impact tests, is conducted to verify in both
simulation results.</p>

<div class="intro">
    <h2 class="we">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Composite materials are the combination of two or more materials that have
      their unique properties. Different types of composite materials are in use today,
meeting the challenges and requirements of a technologically advanced world.
For example applications of composite materials can be found ranging from
space shuttles to huge construction sites. Another reason for the increase in the
uses of composite materials, apart from the combined characteristics of materials
are properties, such as being less expensive, light in weight, and stronger when
compared to common materials. Therefore, the applications of composite
materials are found in diverse fields falling under the material application
definition i.e. requiring materials to achieve the making of an object with
specified properties.
The composite material definition can be simply made from the introduction of
composite materials. Thus, composite materials are the materials that are
produced from the combination of two or more constituent materials. Although
the constituent materials might have different and unique properties, they are
merged together to form material unlike the individual materials and having the
beneficial properties of all the constituents. The difference between composite
materials and mixtures and solid solutions is that within the end product the
individual components remain separate and distinct.</p>

<p>As understood from the composite material definition, a composite material
is made up of two or more constituent materials. The classification of
composite materials depends upon the two types of categories of constituent
materials, which are the matrix and the reinforcement. An optimal
combination of a variety of matrix and reinforcement materials is used to
make composite materials that impart the required characteristics of composite
materials. The matrix provides support to the reinforcement and the
reinforcement, in turn, imparts its own physical and mechanical properties to
the matrix. Thus, both the matrix and the reinforcement provide durability,
sustainability, and utility to the composite material meaning. For making the
composite material, the reinforcement is placed on a mould surface or cavity.
Depending on the matrix material, it is introduced to the reinforcement after
or before being placed in the mould. Following this, the matrix undergoes a
melding event setting up the required shape of the composite material. This
melding can happen in several ways, such as solidification in the case of
melting thermoplastic polymer matrix and chemical polymerization in the case
of the thermoset polymer matrix. This process is the formation step of
engineered composite materials. The moulding methods used depend on the
requirements of the end-product. The nature of matrix and reinforcement
materials influence this step which later defines the characteristics of
composite materials.</p>
